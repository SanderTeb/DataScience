    "## Main goal: Use the provided datasets to answer the following questions\n",
    "1. How is the male-to-female ratio of superheros (marvel + DC) and how does it change over time?\n",
    "2. How does this compare between Marvel and DC superheros?\n",
    "3. How does the look (hair color, eyes ...) change over time?\n",
    "4. Is there a typical look of a bad superhero and of a good superhero?\n",

    "## General instructions\n",
    "- The final notebook should be executable in the correct order (this means it should work if you do `Kernel` --> `Restart kernel and run all cells...`)\n",
    "- Just providing code and plots is not enough, you should document and comment where necessary. Not so much on small code-related things (you may still do this if you want though, but this is not required), but mostly to explain what you do, why you do it, what you observe.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically:\n",
    "- Please briefly comment on the changes you do to the data, in particular, if you apply complex operations or if your changes depend on a certain choice you have to make.\n",
    "- Please add descriptions and/or interpretations to the results you generate (for instance tables, plots). This doesn't have to be a lot of text. For simple, easy-to-understand results, a brief sentence can be enough. For more complex results, you might want to add a bit more explanation."
